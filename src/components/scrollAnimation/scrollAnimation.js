n now use scrollableParentSelector to use ScrollAnimation within any scrolling parent element.
Version 2.0.2
ScrollAnimation components now accept style prop.
Version 2.0.1
animateOnce now works properly.
Version 2.0.0
The "visible" object passed to the afterAnimatedIn and afterAnimatedOut callbacks has the properties "onScreen" which is true if the element is on the screen, and "inViewport", which is true if the element is in the viewport. visible.completely and visible.partially will no longer work.
Should now work on mobile devices.
Should work more consistently with dynamically sized elements (eg, images).
Elements now "animateIn" when any part of them is in the viewport, not only when they are fully contained in the viewport.
The viewport now has a default offset of 150px from the top and bottom of the screen, rather than 100px.

Install Dependencies:

Run Tests:
There are some automated test cases with karma and a Chrome headless browser. I attempted to use Jest, and then to use PhantomJS, but could get neither to work with scroll events. To run them:

npm test
Build the component:
gulp build
Run the Demo project:
cd demo
